# xPts model — v1 results

**Model version:** `v1.0.0`
**Decision:** Build (not buy) — our own model is the intended USP. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-xpts-model-v1-design.md`.

## Data
- Source: backfilled `player_gw_history`, season 2025/26 (FPL-embedded Opta xG).
- Features: exp-decay form (window 6, α 0.85) of xG/xA/xGI/threat/creativity/
  influence/bps/defensive_contribution/total_points; recent starts share (xMinutes
  proxy); opponent strength (home/away-aware); was_home; price. Penalty/set-piece
  order, ownership, and explicit FDR are deferred to v2 (anachronistic or redundant
  for a last-season backtest).

## Model
Per-position linear quantile regression (GKP/DEF/MID/FWD × q 0.25/0.50/0.75),
target = a player-fixture's actual total_points. Coefficients are a dot product
(`model/artifacts/xpts-v1.json`) so Deno serving reproduces them with near-zero skew.

## Validation
Walk-forward over 2025/26 (GW 8→38): for each GW *t*, train on `gw < t`, predict *t*,
accumulate out-of-sample. Evaluated among players with recent starts share ≥ 0.5
(n = 7373).

| metric | model p50 | baseline (c) exp-decay form | last-GW | season PPG |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------|---------|------------|
| MAE (lower better) | 2.063 | 2.444 | 2.716 | 2.333 |
| within-position Spearman | 0.302 | 0.270 | — | — |
| cumulative captaincy points | 185 | 174 | — | — |

Interval coverage of `[p25, p75]`: 0.489 (target ≈ 0.50 ± 0.10).

## Gate
- Beats baseline (c) on MAE: **True**
- Beats baseline (c) on cumulative captaincy: **True**
- Coverage within ±0.10 of 0.50: **True**

**Verdict: ✅ PASS — ship v1 serving (Plan 3)**

## A→C migration trigger (v2)
The `projections` table is the frozen contract; the app reads only it. Move serving
to a Python batch job (Approach C) when the model outgrows a portable dot product
(e.g. GBM/ensemble) such that re-implementing inference in Deno risks train/serve
skew — *not* merely when adding xG data. Until then, serving stays in-stack (Deno
`pg_cron`).
